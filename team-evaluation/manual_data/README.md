Some of the data needed has been impossible for me to obtain through an implementation of a logic that automatically infers certain aspects (or fetch in a proper way), such as data connected to Pokémon **roles**. 

The tables contained in this folder have been indeed generated by me in R with a labouriuos compilation of answers from chatGPT that are based on the content from the Internet or from observations from the #pokémoncommunity. It's data that I even needed to manually refine or curate across several iterations. 
**USE IT AS A PLACEHOLDER**: It's possible that the tables in this folder are not accurate, but I use them as placeholders to keep developing the rest of the functions.

Note: I ignore by this time how any data contained in this folder could be protected, since I manually created it with R.

I would love to have your help about this, either manual input or observations, or if you know a better way to automatically retrieve some of the data in this folder. The ideal scenario would be, though, to create functions that automate these logics and then run multiple checks to see which leads to better results.
